# Control Things Using Mobile

In this workhop we will learn how to control things using a mobile app with arduino and bluetooth module .


### Problem Statement 

We need to get up and walk into the switch board everytime to turn on and off the light or fan etc. 

### Idea

What if, we have a system that can be contol the light and fan using our mobile phone.

### Solution

Using Arduino and Andoird App we can make the idea into a relaity, since the Arduino can turn on and off using programming also it can be attached with bluetooth module, so we can build a mobile app that can be communicate with arduino.
