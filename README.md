# Prototyping

Why Build prototypes? When you have an idea you can begin thinking about how to build it, the first and most fundamental question you must answer is this: Are you building the right thing? The purpose of prototyping is to answer that question.

Prototyping is an itrative process that begin with something as simple as a sketch, a computer design, or a physical mock up. This earliest stage is a low-fidelity prototype , and its purpose is to begin testing the idea, to begin answering those questions about whether this is something customer want. Even before this earliest stage of prototyping, designers, engineers, and business people get together, interview stakeholders, and begin to devlop an idea of what exactly this product is going to be answering those same questions. It's those earliest requirements that go into making a low-fidelity prototype. (Src:Prototyping with purpose|Mouser Electronics).
